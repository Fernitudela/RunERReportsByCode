It includes the logic to add some fields and UI behaviour to the ERSolutionTable, and 3 abstract classes that include all the logic and that you will have to extend (inherit) to create new ER report execution processes, that you will be able to call from a menu item in your child controller. 

In my youtube video: https://youtu.be/7LsKVV62jjw  and my blog post: http://fernitudela.dev/?p=1090 You will find a further explanation of how the solution works as well as a step by step example of how to implement it.

In the solution you will also find a Sample implementation to help you with an example. The sample implementation includes the following objects:
